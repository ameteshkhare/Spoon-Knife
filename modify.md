## Hello all this is an easy way to fork.
I was just trying to practice the forking session and then making changes by adding a new text documents on the forked
repository.
I have observed that since this module is a basic course, students dont practice the forking in detail.
If we encourage people to fork and then modify the content and submit the same for changes would be helpful in understanding the concept 
much better.
